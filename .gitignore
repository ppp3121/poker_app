# Note: Cargo.lock is often committed to ensure reproducible builds.
# However, for solo development across machines where dependencies might
# need resolving differently, ignoring it can sometimes be simpler.
# For team projects, you should almost always commit Cargo.lock.
# We are ignoring it here for simplicity, but feel free to remove the line above
# if you want to lock your dependency versions across PCs.
